An autonomous multi-robot exploration system using ROS2, enabling multiple TurtleBot3 robots to collaboratively navigate and map unknown environments. The system integrates SLAM, random-walk exploration, and real-time map merging for efficient terrain coverage. RViz visualization allows monitoring of the robots' progress and merged maps dynamically.
