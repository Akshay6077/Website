Engineered an optimized 3D semantic scene completion system for autonomous driving applications, focusing on efficient environment perception and real-time processing. The system leverages MobileNet integration and a novel two-stage pipeline to generate accurate 3D scene reconstructions from 2D inputs, enabling robust obstacle detection and scene understanding within a 30-meter range. This implementation achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational demands, making it ideal for real-world autonomous driving scenarios.
