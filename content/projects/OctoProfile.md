This project focuses on developing a 6-DoF Virtual Shake Robot (VSR) to simulate earthquake-induced motion for studying the response of structures and geological features.
Traditional 6-DoF shake tables are essential but costly and limited in accessibility. The current VSR operates on a single axis, restricting the scope of experiments.
By expanding to a 6-DoF VSR, we aim to enhance the simulation capabilities, enabling more accurate and versatile earthquake studies. This system will offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for researchers to test seismic effects on different structures,
contributing to advancements in earthquake science and safety.
