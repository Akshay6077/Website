- Led the development of a simulation tool leveraging PyBullet to study the dynamics of Precariously Balanced Rocks (PBRs) during large displacement events, contributing to seismic hazard analysis and rockfall predictions.
- Developed robust algorithms to control pedestal motion using advanced robotics and physics principles, allowing for precise experimentation on rock behavior under varying seismic conditions.
- Integrated ROS2 to streamline the automation of experiments, including the control of pedestal movements based on real-time feedback.
- Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to analyze data from simulated experiments and compare it with real-world PBR behavior, enhancing the accuracy of rockfall prediction models.
